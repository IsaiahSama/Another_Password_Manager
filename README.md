# Look Another Password Manager
Welcome to LAPM, a password manager designed by IsaiahSama, which acts as a wrapper for my API which can be found here: https://github.com/IsaiahSama/LAPasswordManager

# Features
LAPM allows you to securely store your passwords both online, and locally (on your device), and supports syncing between the two. This means that even without internet, you will still have access to all of your passwords, and will be able to Create, View, Update and Delete them as normal. Then of course, when you have internet, you can then sync so the server has your same changes, and you can access them from any device.

# How to Use
Using is actually very simple.
For those of you that aren't familiar with git, or python, just click the `LA_PasswordManager.exe` file above, where you'll see a button called `Download`. Just click it, save it where you desire, and to run it, just double click it. Simple.

For those of you that are familiar with python and git, simply pull the repository. Feel free to delete the `Old` folder, as that is just the previous version of this project. After you pull the repository, simply install the `requirements.txt` file, and then run the `main.py` file which is inside the `app` directory.

# Before Using
When running the application for the first time, you'll realize that you will get an error. This error will let you know that the account that you have created doesn't exist on the server. So first, just visit https://lapasswordmanager.herokuapp.com/login/?mode=register, to create an account. And boom... that's it. 

# Note
If you don't create or register an account, you can still use the app, although just in offline mode. This means that all of your updates and changes, will only be done on your device. Then of course, when you decide to create your account, you can then simply push your local changes to your account, (Using the sync feature which is only available when you are online), and just like that, they're saved.

Easy

If you encounter any problems with the app, feel free to email me at zeldaplayergl@gmail.com.
