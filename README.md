# Py-wordman

## About
This project is a Password Manager made using python. It's very easy, direct, and straight forward to use. 

## Features
### Main Menu
The main menu is where you can select 1 of 6 options based on the corresponding number.


### Create
This is option 2. Allow you to add in the account that you desire and use that as your access to the password. For example. Say I wanted to save the password to like my steam account. For the name I would put Isamabevibin@gmail.com, then for the password I'd put my password of Isamazawarudo21. It will then save it, and it will be able to be accessed again from option 3

### Read
Option 3 is read. This shows you a list of all that you have registered so far, and allows you to pick the name of the one whose password you wish to view.

### Edit
Option 4, the edit, allows you to edit the password of an existing "account", say you changed it or had a typo or something. Does not change the account_name itself however, only the value which is the password

### Delete
Option 5, allows you to delete a registered account/password pair.

### Exit
Option 6, closes the program.
