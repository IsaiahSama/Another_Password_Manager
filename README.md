# Py-wordman

## About
This Python Password Manager (Py-wordman as I call it), is a uhm... Password Manager made using python. It's very easy, direct, and straight forward to use. I created it simply because I wanted a password manager... and I thought that I could create my own using Python, so why didn't I. Py-wordman supports full CRUD as you would expect, and does store the files locally. It isn't anything high-tech like storing them in a different folder, just stores them locally, the same place where you run the file/exe. :)

## Features
### Main Menu
The main menu is where you can select 1 of 5 options based on the corresponding number.

### Create
This is option 1. Allow you to add in the account that you desire and use that as your access to the password. For example. Say I wanted to save the password to like my steam account. For the name I would put Isamabevibin@gmail.com, then for the password I'd put my password of Isamazawarudo21. It will then save it, and it will be able to be accessed again from option 2

### Read
Option 2 is read. This shows you a list of all that you have registered so far, and allows you to pick the name of the one whose password you wish to view.

### Edit
Option 3, the edit, allows you to edit the password of an existing "account", say you changed it or had a typo or something. Does not change the account_name itself however, only the value which is the password

### Delete
Option 4, allows you to delete a registered account/password pair.

### Exit
Option 5, closes the program.
